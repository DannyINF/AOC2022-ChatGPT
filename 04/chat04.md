Space needs to be cleared before the last supplies can be unloaded from the ships, and so several Elves have been assigned the job of cleaning up sections of the camp. Every section has a unique ID number, and each Elf is assigned a range of section IDs.  
However, as some of the Elves compare their section assignments with each other, they've noticed that many of the assignments overlap. To try to quickly find overlaps and reduce duplicated effort, the Elves pair up and make a big list of the section assignments for each pair (your puzzle input).  
For example, consider the following list of section assignment pairs:  
2-4,6-8  
2-3,4-5  
5-7,7-9  
2-8,3-7  
6-6,4-6  
2-6,4-8  
For the first few pairs, this list means:  
Within the first pair of Elves, the first Elf was assigned sections 2-4 (sections 2, 3, and 4), while the second Elf was assigned sections 6-8 (sections 6, 7, 8).  
The Elves in the second pair were each assigned two sections.  
The Elves in the third pair were each assigned three sections: one got sections 5, 6, and 7, while the other also got 7, plus 8 and 9.
This example list uses single-digit section IDs to make it easier to draw; your actual list might contain larger numbers. Visually, these pairs of section assignments look like this:  
.234.....  2-4  
.....678.  6-8  
.23......  2-3  
...45....  4-5  
....567..  5-7  
......789  7-9  
.2345678.  2-8  
..34567..  3-7  
.....6...  6-6  
...456...  4-6  
.23456...  2-6  
...45678.  4-8  
Some of the pairs have noticed that one of their assignments fully contains the other. For example, 2-8 fully contains 3-7, and 6-6 is fully contained by 4-6. In pairs where one assignment fully contains the other, one Elf in the pair would be exclusively cleaning sections their partner will already be cleaning, so these seem like the most in need of reconsideration. In this example, there are 2 such pairs.  
In how many assignment pairs does one range fully contain the other?

> To solve this puzzle, we need to read in the input from the file "04/aoc04.txt" and then iterate through each line of the file. We can then split each line on the comma character and then split each sub-string on the hyphen character to obtain the start and end values of the section range. We can then check if one range fully contains the other and count the number of such pairs.  
Here is one way to solve this puzzle in Python:
```py
# Open the input file
with open("04/aoc04.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read all lines from the file
    lines = file.readlines()

# Initialize the counter for the number of pairs
num_pairs = 0

# Iterate through each line in the file
for line in lines:
    # Split the line on the comma character
    sections = line.strip().split(",")

    # Iterate through each pair of sections
    for i in range(len(sections)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(sections)):
            # Split the sections on the hyphen character to get the start and end values
            start1, end1 = map(int, sections[i].split("-"))
            start2, end2 = map(int, sections[j].split("-"))

            # Check if one range fully contains the other
            if (start1 <= start2 and end1 >= end2) or (start2 <= start1 and end2 >= end1):
                # If it does, increment the counter
                num_pairs += 1

# Print the result
print(num_pairs)
```

It seems like there is still quite a bit of duplicate work planned. Instead, the Elves would like to know the number of pairs that overlap at all.  
In the above example, the first two pairs (2-4,6-8 and 2-3,4-5) don't overlap, while the remaining four pairs (5-7,7-9, 2-8,3-7, 6-6,4-6, and 2-6,4-8) do overlap:  
5-7,7-9 overlaps in a single section, 7.  
2-8,3-7 overlaps all of the sections 3 through 7.  
6-6,4-6 overlaps in a single section, 6.  
2-6,4-8 overlaps in sections 4, 5, and 6.  
So, in this example, the number of overlapping assignment pairs is 4.  
In how many assignment pairs do the ranges overlap?

> To solve this puzzle, we can modify the code from the previous solution to check for pairs that overlap at all instead of checking for pairs where one range fully contains the other. We can do this by checking if the end value of one range is greater than or equal to the start value of the other range, which indicates that the ranges overlap.  
Here is an updated version of the code that solves this puzzle:
```py
# Open the input file
with open("04/aoc04.txt", "r") as file:
    # Read all lines from the file
    lines = file.readlines()

# Initialize the counter for the number of pairs
num_pairs = 0

# Iterate through each line in the file
for line in lines:
    # Split the line on the comma character
    sections = line.strip().split(",")

    # Iterate through each pair of sections
    for i in range(len(sections)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(sections)):
            # Split the sections on the hyphen character to get the start and end values
            start1, end1 = map(int, sections[i].split("-"))
            start2, end2 = map(int, sections[j].split("-"))

            # Check if the ranges overlap
            if end1 >= start2 or end2 >= start1:
                # If they do, increment the counter
                num_pairs += 1

# Print the result
print(num_pairs)
```

```
> This code is similar to the previous solution, but it uses the `and` operator instead of the `or` operator to check if the ranges overlap. This ensures that the ranges overlap in at least one section, rather than just having an end value that is greater than or equal to the start value of the other range. This will produce the correct result for this puzzle.
