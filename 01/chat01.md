The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of Calories each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).  
The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.  
For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:
```
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

> This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:  
The first Elf is carrying food with 1000, 2000, and 3000 Calories, a total of 6000 Calories.  
The second Elf is carrying one food item with 4000 Calories.  
The third Elf is carrying food with 5000 and 6000 Calories, a total of 11000 Calories.  
The fourth Elf is carrying food with 7000, 8000, and 9000 Calories, a total of 24000 Calories.  
The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with 10000 Calories.  
In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the most Calories. In the example above, this is 24000 (carried by the fourth Elf).  
Find the Elf carrying the most Calories. How many total Calories is that Elf carrying?

> To solve this puzzle, we need to read the input file, parse the numbers, and keep track of the Elf with the most calories. Here is one way to do this in Python:
```py
# Open the input file and read the lines
with open('01/aoc01.txt') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

# Parse the numbers from the input and store them in a list
calories = []
for line in lines:
    if line.strip(): # ignore blank lines
        calories.append(int(line.strip()))

# Keep track of the Elf with the most calories
max_calories = 0
max_elf = 0
current_elf = 0
current_calories = 0
for i, c in enumerate(calories):
    current_calories += c
    if i % 3 == 2: # every third item is a new Elf's inventory
        if current_calories > max_calories:
            max_calories = current_calories
            max_elf = current_elf
        current_elf += 1
        current_calories = 0

# Print the result
print(f"Elf {max_elf + 1} is carrying the most calories: {max_calories}")
```
> This code will read the input file, parse the numbers, and keep track of the Elf with the most calories. At the end, it will print the result in the format "Elf X is carrying the most calories: Y", where X is the Elf number and Y is the number of calories they are carrying.

> The fastest and shortest way to solve this puzzle in python is to use the following code:
```py
with open("01/aoc01.txt") as f:
    calories = [sum(int(line.strip()) for line in group.strip().split('\n')) for group in f.read().split('\n\n') if group.strip()]
    print(max(calories))
```
> This code first opens the input file and reads its contents into a string. It then splits the string by double newlines, which separates the different Elves' inventories. For each inventory, it splits it by newlines and converts each item to an integer, then sums them up to get the total number of calories for that Elf. It stores the results in a list and prints the maximum value in the list, which is the total number of calories carried by the Elf carrying the most calories.

> this is correct, now solve this puzzle aswell:  
By the time you calculate the answer to the Elves' question, they've already realized that the Elf carrying the most Calories of food might eventually run out of snacks.  
To avoid this unacceptable situation, the Elves would instead like to know the total Calories carried by the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. That way, even if one of those Elves runs out of snacks, they still have two backups.  
In the example above, the top three Elves are the fourth Elf (with 24000 Calories), then the third Elf (with 11000 Calories), then the fifth Elf (with 10000 Calories). The sum of the Calories carried by these three elves is 45000.  
Find the top three Elves carrying the most Calories. How many Calories are those Elves carrying in total?

> To solve this puzzle, we can modify the code from the previous solution to get the top three Elves carrying the most calories. The modified code would look like this:

```py
with open("01/aoc01.txt") as f:
    calories = [sum(int(line.strip()) for line in group.strip().split('\n')) for group in f.read().split('\n\n') if group.strip()]
    top_three = sorted(calories, reverse=True)[:3]
    print(sum(top_three))
```

For each inventory, it splits it by newlines and converts each item to an integer, then sums them up to get the total number of calories for that Elf. It stores the results in a list and sorts it in descending order. It then takes the first three elements from the sorted list, which are the Elves carrying the most calories. It finally prints the sum of these top three Elves' calories, which is the total number of calories carried by the top three Elves.
